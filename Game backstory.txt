Storyline to my python game

Back Story

The main character(Terry) has recovered from an accident, doctors has discovered that the force suffered to his head has removed his memory,
(career and achievements). Terry has been cleared from Hospital, doctors has stated that he is healthy and that he will begin to recover his memory,
once he walks around the house and notices all the things he has achieved, maybe the fact that he is at home would bring back his memory.

Aim of the game
Playing as the character Terry, the objective of the game is to help Terry recover his memory via collecting parts of his career that has lead him up until now,
this not only gives you insight as his helper, but allows terry to get back to work as quick as possible and become a baller.

Rage quit obstacles
Although healthy, he still suffers flashback of the crash and can somewhat recall what happened, these memories are to be avoided because it could erase all
the progress he has made, who knows maybe even kill him (jk im not that horrible, but seriously though dont let the car crash memories get you, or you will
reset the game and you will start from the beginning)

Setting
Well if you havent noticed by now, the setting of the game is within his home
